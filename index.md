### Who are you?
![](images/who.png)

My name is Evan Kaufman, and I am a developer. Professionally, my focus has been on web development, but I'm a frequent open source contributor and a technological jack of all trades.

### What is this?

In lieu of the stereotypical "seldom updated personal blog", this is a low maintenance and single page personal site.

### How do I contact you?

**If you are a recruiter, please _do not_. I am happy where I am.** Otherwise, you can find me on any of the following services...
